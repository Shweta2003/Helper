## Problem Statement : 


Many senior citizens face challenges when it comes to using technology. They may not have grown up with technology, and therefore, find it challenging to adopt new technologies. Some of the common problems faced by senior citizens when it comes to technology are:


Lack of Familiarity, Physical Limitations, Fear of Technology, Limited Access to Resources, Security Concerns.


'Helper' application is specifically designed for senior citizens can help address these challenges. The application can have a user-friendly interface that is easy to navigate, large font sizes, and high-contrast colors to accommodate those with visual impairments. It Overall, creating an application that is tailored to the needs of senior citizens can help improve their quality of life and allow them to stay connected with their loved ones and the world around them, and this aim has been successfullyÂ implemented.


## Proposed Solution : 

We have attempted to create an application for the ease of senior citizens.


Through our application, the user can easily interact with the system/android because we provide multi language system so that even if they don't understand english, they are able to read and use the android devices.

We have also provided the user with a calendar system, where they can store their day-to-day activity list so that they don't forget their important appointments and get a reminder on time.

Another feature of the app allows the user to select a particular task to be completed(household work/ plumber/ electrician etc) and then the database selects a worker and allows the user to hire them. This feature will also increase the job opportunities and because the workers and trusted and in partnership with our team, user will be safe to communicate and interact with them.

The app also provides a feature to add new contacts to your phone. The user might not remeber the name or number he/she saved, so for their convinience, we have provided the feature to add an image immediately while saving a contact so that they can remember them and while calling it is easier for them to find the contacts.

Another feature of the app is to provide an offline database of music which can help the user meditate and explore other language music. They can listen to them even without internet for their convinience.

The last but not the least, we have provided an emergency button which can work as an identity for the senior citizens. It displays the details of the user so that if in case they are in emergency and are at an unknown place, people can look at this section of their apps to identify them and on the emergency calling list, we have provided the number for their guardian so that they can immediately be informed and user can get help as soon as possible.

## Funcitonality and Concept :



The app has a very simple and interactive interface that helps the user to handle the application.


Following are a few android concepts used to achieve the functionalities in the app:


Constraint Layout: Most of the activities in the app uses a flexible constraint layout, which is easy to handle for different screen sizes.


Dark and Light Mode: This app can automatically adopt to light or dark mode as required for better display and interaction with the user.


Simple & Easy Views Design: Use of familiar audience EditText with hints and interactive buttons made it easier for Users to move around and explore the app.


Recycler-View: To go back to the user menu and keep searching back and forth until user is sure about what to order and clicks the confirm button.


The notification feature in our application provides users with timely alerts and updates regarding their appointments within the application. These notifications are delivered directly to the user's device, making it easy for them to stay informed and up-to-date.


In-app notifications are displayed within the application when the user is actively using it. These notifications are typically used to provide the user with updates about their current appointment


The language translation feature in our application provides users with the ability to translate text into multiple languages. This feature is designed to make the application accessible to users who speak different languages and to facilitate communication between users who speak different languages
To use the language translation feature, users simply need to select language from list and click ok.


in our application allows users to easily search for and hire workers for various tasks. This feature is designed to help users find qualified workers quickly and easily, without having to go through the traditional hiring process.
Our application allows workers to create profiles that showcase their skills, experience, and availability. Users can search for workers based on these criteria to find the best match for their task.


Our application provides users with the ability to listen to their favorite music even when they are not connected to the internet. This feature is designed to provide users with a seamless music listening experience, regardless of their internet connection.


Our application provides users with a convenient and visually appealing way to manage their contacts by allowing them to save contact numbers with images. This feature is designed to make it easy for users to quickly identify and call their contacts.



## Future Scope :


The application has limited language scope right now. In future we plan to increase the language range so that different masses can access it. 


We also plan to include voice recognition and functioning to increase the interactivity of user with android apps so that it's more easy for them to use the application. 


We also plan to include other features like access to nearby welfare/ old age homes so that they can interact with other people and feel more involved in the society. 


In the future the worker database can also be increased and categorized based on the location so that it is easy for the user to find the most reliable worker for them and this will also increase the job opportunities in respective localities.

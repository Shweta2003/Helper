# **HELPER**


## Problem Statement : 


Many senior citizens face challenges when it comes to using technology. They may not have grown up with technology, and therefore, find it challenging to adopt new technologies. Some of the common problems faced by senior citizens when it comes to technology are:


Lack of Familiarity, Physical Limitations, Fear of Technology, Limited Access to Resources, Security Concerns.


'Helper' application is specifically designed for senior citizens can help address these challenges. The application can have a user-friendly interface that is easy to navigate, large font sizes, and high-contrast colors to accommodate those with visual impairments. It Overall, creating an application that is tailored to the needs of senior citizens can help improve their quality of life and allow them to stay connected with their loved ones and the world around them, and this aim has been successfullyÂ implemented.


## Proposed Solution : 

We have attempted to create an application for the ease of senior citizens.


Through our applocation, the user can easily interact with the system/android because we provide multi language system so that even if they don't understand english, they are able to read and use the android devices.

We have also provided the user with a calender system, where they can store their day-to-day activity list so that they don't forget their important appointments and get a reminder on time.

Another feature of the app allows the user to select a particular task to be completed(household work/ plumber/ electrician etc) and then the database selects a worker and allows the user to hire them. This feature will also increase the job opportunities and because the workers and trusted and in partnership with our team, user will be safe to communicate and interact with them.

The app also provides a feature to add new contacts to your phone. The user might not remeber the name or number he/she saved, so for their convinience, we have provided the feature to add an image immediately while saving a contact so that they can remember them and while calling it is easier for them to find the contacts.

Another feature of the app is to provide an offline database of music which can help the user meditate and explore other language music. They can listen to them even without internet for their convinience.

The last but not the least, we have provided an emergency button which can work as an identity for the senior citizens. It displays the details of the user so that if in case they are in emergency and are at an unknown place, people can look at this section of their apps to identify them and on the emergency calling list, we have provided the number for their guardian so that they can immediately be informed and user can get help as soon as possible.
